# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I'm working through the puzzles as time permits. Contained in this repo are my solutions.
